<br/>CSA can not detect it because :<br/>
1. The exploit **chain is too long**, accross thousands lines of code, CSA can not handle it.<br/>
   
2. CSA **can not handle loops** that causes this bug very well, even a simple example without a long exploit chain can still not be detected. <br/>

Hereï¼Œlet's have a try to use CSA to analyze a simple [test file](removeending.c) removeeding.c

<br/>
We can see here is a simple example of this bug, for simplicity, we set the length of `word` to `20` and `word_copy` to `14`, let's see what's going on when analyze this program with clang setting like below:<br/>

<br/>
After 57 seconds, the bug is found. However, if the size of `word_copy` is `180` like in the real project, the time cost would be unacceptable.
