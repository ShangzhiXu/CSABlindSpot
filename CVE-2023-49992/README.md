<br/>CSA can not detect it because :<br/>
1. The exploit chain is too long, accross thousands lines of code, CSA can not handle it.<br/>
   Hereï¼Œlet's have a try to use CSA to analyze a simple [test file](removeendding.c) removeeding.c
3. CSA can not handle loops that may cause this bug very well, even a simple example without a long exploit chain can still not be detected.
